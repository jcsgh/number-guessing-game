// how to play
// there is a random number chosen between 1-100
// the player and computer (or second player?) are playing against each other to guess the number
//  (optional) the players have a limited amount of tries (determined by difficulty level) to guess the number
// if the player guesses the numberbefore the computer does, than the player gets a point
// if the player and the computer both guess the number in the same amount of tries than none get points
// if the computer guesses before the player does, the computer gets a point
// whoever gets five points first, wins 
// ask if the player wants to play again
